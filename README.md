### Audio to Indian Sign Language (ISL) Translator
---

In this project, we have tried to develop a software that would be helpful for the disabled people having communication difficulties by developing a system that would help them in expressing themselves clearly and easily.

Our model takes an Audio input and converts it to text, which will then be parsed and converted to sign language and displayed. It is a project in Social domain which will benefit the society.

The target audience for this system is not limited to hearing impaired individuals as communication for hearing impaired people in common places like railway stations, bus stands, banks, hospitals etc is very difficult because a vocal person may not understand sign language and thus wonâ€™t be able to convey any message to hearing impaired person. Thus, it is targeted to all those who wish to learn this translation, to facilitate better communication.
